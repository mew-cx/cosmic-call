# Rationale
In the document, the message bitmaps are broken apart to explain their various content.
I have not been able to find the actually-sent bit-exact messages,
so I'm trying to recreate them here.

Many of the sites hosting information about the messages have disappeared,
so I'm trying to save local copies for posterity.
I'm also saving URLs to resources that are still available at time of writing (2021).

_Disclaimer:_ Nothing I've created should be considered authoritative.
I'm simply attempting to recreate data from upstream sources.

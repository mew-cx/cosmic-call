<a class="storytitle" name="emotions" href="https://blog.plover.com/aliens/emotions.html">Emotions</a>
<br />

I was planning to write another article about &pi;, and its appearance
in Coulomb's law, or perhaps an article about how to calculate the volume
of a higher-dimensional analogue of a sphere.  <p>

But John Speno says he always skips the math stuff on my blog, and the
last couple of days have been unrelievedly mathematical.  So instead,
John, I have written an article about the comparison of emotions,
whether the 18-toed Sirian ghost worms will understand why you are
holding your nose, Homer Simpson, the evolutionary justification for
disgust, the Indiana Pacers cheerleading squad, Paris Hilton, and
maggots.  Skip this, I <i>dare</i> you.<p>

<hr>

My shrink had a little trope that she'd trot out when she asked me how
I had felt about something and I wasn't sure.  "Mad, sad, glad,
scared," she'd say, and that was helpful, because those four do cover
an awful lot of situations.  And learning to recognize those four is
very important.<p>

But one day she pushed the idea too far and asserted that those
were the only emotions there are.  <p>

That's clearly wrong.  Even discounting emotions that might be
considered variations on the big four, such as: 
(anger) rage, annoyance, resentment, frustration,
(sadness) grief, disappointment, remorse, loneliness,
(happiness) delight, joy, pride, 
(fear) nervousness, dread, terror, panic,
and so on, we still have:<p>

<ul>
<li> Boredom
<li> Disgust
<li> Envy
<li> Guilt
<li> Jealousy
<li> Lust
<li> Shame
<li> Surprise
</ul>

It's funny that a shrink would forget about guilt, but there you
are.<p>

Some of these may require explanation.  People sometimes use the word
"disgust" metaphorically to refer to a feeling that is really nine
parts anger to one part boredom, as when they say they are disgusted
with the state of American politics.  But that's not what I mean by it
here.  The disgust I'm referring to is the feeling you have when you
have been on vacation and come back to discover that the power went out
while you were away and the meat in the refrigerator has spoiled and
slid out onto the kitchen floor where it is now festering with
thousands of squirming, white, eyeless maggots, and the instant you
see it, your reaction is to (a) turn away, (b) hold your nose, and (c)
vomit.  I suppose it's possible that some people would have that very
reaction to American politics; it's certainly understandable.  But I
don't think that's what people usually mean when they say that
politics disgusts them.  Or if they do mean it, they mean it only in a
hyperbolic sense.<p>

People often confuse guilt and shame, but they are really orthogonal.
You feel guilt when you have done something you believe is ethically
or morally wrong.  You feel shame when <i>other people</i> observe you
doing something that they shouldn't see, whether or not that thing is
ethically or morally wrong.  The problem is with the observing, not
with the thing that is being observed.  I think the following example
will help clear up the confusion: One might or might not feel guilty
about picking one's nose, although I think most people don't feel
guilty when they do it.  But even someone who picks their nose
entirely without guilt, probably feels ashamed if someone else catches
them in the act.  <p>

The other two that are often confused are envy and jealousy.  Here I
think the confusion is caused simply because people don't know what
the words mean.  Envy is what you feel when you want what someone else
has; you can envy someone else's car or their lunch or their special
relationship with their lover.  Jealousy is much more specific. You
are jealous when you <i>have</i> a special relationship with a person,
and you are afraid that you are going to lose them to a third person.
You can  envy someone else's possession of a ham sandwich, but
jealousy of a ham sandwich is impossible.<p>

I might be willing to believe the proposition these eight, plus the
original four (anger, sadness, happiness, and fear) constitute a
complete set of "primary colors" for human emotion, and that you can
consider the others as being mixtures of various amounts of these
twelve.  For example, you go up on stage to accept an award, and your
trousers fall off, and you feel embarrassed.  What is embarrassment?
It's maybe five parts shame, two parts fear, and one part surprise.
Take away any of these three things, and you no longer have
embarrassment, but something else.  Add in anger and you have
humiliation.<p>

If someone wants to argue that jealousy is compounded from fear,
anger, and envy, and should be removed from the list in favor of
affection or confusion, I won't complain.  The list is necessarily
dependent on culture, and even more so on the individual making it.
Not every culture will have anything like jealousy; perhaps most
won't.  Romantic love seems to be a uniquely European invention,
dating from around the 13th century.  <p>

Another problem with the list is that even within one culture, there
may not be agreement on which kinds of feelings qualify as emotions.
Does hunger qualify?  Or fatigue?  It seems to me that some emotions
are more rooted in the physical processes of the body, and others less
so.  Guilt is at the "high" end of that scale: it refers to a feeling
you have in your mind when you have done something that you feel you
shouldn't have.  It is hardly associated with the body at all.  A
brain in a vat could feel guilt, and probably does.  At the "low" end
of the scale is disgust, the experience of which is much less about an
the social constructions in your mind than it is about your stomach
trying to turn itself inside out.  I think hunger and fatigue are even
farther down the scale of body-vs-mind than disgust; below even those
is pain, and at the very bottom are feelings like the one you have in
your arm when you open a door, which is purely physical and has no
emotional content whatsoever.  The counterparts at the top end of the
scale are plans, analyses, and the like, which are purely mental and
have no emotional content.  Emotion is somewhere in between, and I can
imagine that someone else could want to exclude disgust or guilt from
a list of emotions because they were too far down from the middle of
the scale.<p>

An exercise I love to do is to try to consider what we will have in
common with the space aliens.  For example, do the space aliens
consider the P=NP problem interesting?  Do the space aliens consider
the set of real numbers as a fundamental object, or as an obscure
construction only of interest to set theorists?  I will probably
address these topics in future articles.  Meanwhile, this article,
believe it or not, started out as a discussion of whether the space
aliens, when they arrive, will already know how to play chess.  (Well,
obviously not.  But it is less obvious that they will not already know
how to play go.  I will write that article sooner or later.)<p>

But now we might ask what kinds of emotions the aliens will have.  The
question seems at first glance to be completely impossible.  But I
believe that partial answers are possible.  <p>

As emotions get higher up on the body-to-mind scale, it becomes less
likely that they will be shared by the aliens; such emotions are not
even cross-cultural among humans.  Our experience of guilt is very much
dependent on our culture, and in particular on our relationship to law
and authority, much of which is the result of two thousand years of
Christian philosophizing.  The converse is that emotions that are low
on the body-to-mind scale are much more universal among people.
Perhaps not everyone feels guilt.  But everyone feels disgust.<p>

Disgust is particularly easy to analyze from the point of view of
natural selection.  It is to a large extent an aversion to dangerous
biohazards: rotten food and carcasses; decay, including mold, and
things that look like mold; excrement, vomit, and other body
substances that should be inside but that have come out;
disembowelment and bodily mutilation; deformity and disease.  Rotting
meat is extremely poisonous, so an automatic aversion reaction makes
evolutionary sense: the people who turned away in disgust lived longer
than the people who saw an opportunity for a free lunch.  Excrement,
and particularly human excrement, harbors bacteria dangerous to humans,
so an automatic aversion reaction makes evolutionary sense.  Deformity
is similar.  Perhaps whatever caused it is not contagious&mdash;but
perhaps it is, and evolution wants to stay on the safe side.<p>

I think it is inevitable that the aliens will have these same kinds of
reactions, for the same reasons.  Aliens will have a strong aversion
reaction if you put them in front of a chunk of rotting alien flesh, or
show them an alien with its internal organs on the outside.  Why?
Because those things are dangerous to aliens, and so all the aliens
who didn't have that reaction have died long ago of horrible diseases.
I don't think it's a big step to identify this reaction with
disgust.<p>

Similarly, aliens might not have eyes, if they come from a place with
no ambient short-wavelength electromagnetic radiation; say, the
surface of Jupiter.  But the aliens <i>will</i> have chemical senses,
analogous to smell and taste, because there are chemicals everywhere.
Every life form on earth has chemical senses, even down to bacteria.
This is because you cannot use the Homer Simpson strategy of 
ingesting everything you encounter; you would quickly die.  (Homer is
fictitious, or he would be dead long ago.)  You need some way of
distinguishing which items are food, so that you can eat the things
that are food and ignore the other things.  So you need to have a
sense of smell and taste.<p>

What happens when you smell or taste something that is really harmful?
You had better have some kind of aversion reaction, and you do,
because all the 18-toed Sirian ghost worms without those reactions ate
stuff that disagreed with them, and died young; you are the product of
a long line of ghost worms that do have a sense of smell and feel
disgust when they wander into a biohazard zone.<p>

We can push this even further.  I conjecture that we can even predict
some of the aliens' body language.  When presented with something that
smells bad&mdash;say rotten food&mdash;an alien's response will be to <i>hold
its nose</i>, if it has an olfactory sense that can be disabled by
closing the organ off from the outside world.  If the alien asks me
what I think of Paris Hilton, and I hold my nose, the alien will
understand that Paris Hilton is being insulted, and will understand
something of the way in which Paris Hilton is being insulted.
Chemical senses, I think, must be so universal that even noseless
aliens will understand the gesture, once the structure and function of
the human nose is explained to them.  "Oh, I see," says the alien.
"You have closed off your chemical sense organ so that
Ms.&nbsp;Hilton's noxious effluvia cannot penetrate.  Yes, I quite
understand!    Unfortunately, for us it is not possible since our olfactory
bulbs are distributed throughout our skins.
But I am sure we have all wanted to do something like that at one time or
another."<p>

Disgust, being one of the lowest emotions on the mind-body scale, is
one of the easiest to attribute to the aliens.  Even going a little
higher is risky.  Will the aliens feel lust?  Quite possibly.  Even a
giant amoeba that reproduces by fission might feel something akin to
lust when the time comes, a powerful urge to divide in two.  Will the
aliens feel anger?  Perhaps, but here we're on shaky ground.<p>

Long ago, I had a conversation with Matthew Stone, in which he told me
how different cultures have different notions of even apparently
simple emotions such as rage.  Rage, he said, is characterized by the
following situation: you want something, but there is some
insurmountable obstacle to your getting it, and so you are frustrated.
When you become enraged, your response is to attack the obstacle and
try to destroy it.<p>

But, said M.&nbsp;Stone, in Polish, when you want something, and there
is an insurmountable obstacle, and you are frustrated, you do not have
a fit of rage in which you go nuts and attack the obstacle.  Instead,
you have a fit of z&#x142;ost, in which you go nuts and attack
everything around you at random.<p>

Or, in some other culture that I forget, if you want something to
which there is an insurmountable obstacle, and you are frustrated,
then you have a fit of some emotion I don't remember the name of, in
which you go nuts and kill yourself.<p>

These seem to me to be distinctly different from rage, if not
fundamentally so.  Variations on jealousy are even easier to
invent.<p>

I don't know how much of all this is true, how much was wrong before
M.&nbsp;Stone heard it, how much he said that was right but I
misunderstood, and how much I understood correctly but got wrong
between then and now.  It might all be nonsense.  But one can still
get some mileage out of attributing z&#x142;ost, rather than rage, to
the aliens.<p>

Embarrassment is another one of the more universal emotions.  I've
seen my cat act embarrassed, typically when he falls off of a ledge,
or tries to jump from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i> but only makes it partway,
and goes splat.  <p>

There's another kind of embarrassment that occurs when you see
something you shouldn't.  For example, you walk into a room and see
your mother-in-law putting on her bra.  You are likely to feel
embarrassed.  What's the connection with the embarrassment you feel
when you fall off a ledge?  I don't know; I'm not even sure they are
the same.  Perhaps we need a new word.<p>

The Indiana Pacers basketball team has <a
href="http://www.nba.com/pacers/dance/index.html">a web site</a> on
which they list the "most embarrassing moments" of each of their
cheerleaders, the Pacemates.  (I keep wanting to call them the
"Pacemakers", but even I know that is wrong.)<p>

When I first planned to discuss this, it was because my random sample
of responses picked up mostly strange ones, and I was ready to
conclude that the Pacemates and I were not of the same species.  I
planned to complain that none of the Pacemates had apparently ever
farted in public.  But a more thorough survey revealed that the
Pacemates were much less surprising in their embarrassment than I had
originally thought.  As embarrassing moments go, you would be
hard-pressed to find a more typical example than that of falling down
in the middle of a carefully-choreographed public dance exhibition,
and that is mostly what they said.   Both I and my cat can understand
the embarrassment of these mishaps:<p>

<blockquote>
<a
href="http://www.nba.com/pacers/dance/pacemate_profile_lindsay_2005.html"><b>Lindsay:</b></a>
I usually don't get embarrassed, but one time, I did fall off stage at
a national dance competition.<p>

<a
href="http://www.nba.com/pacers/dance/pacemate_profile_darcy_2005.html"><b>Darcy:</b></a>
Last year during Pacers player introductions when the lights were out,
Boomer ran into me and knocked me down to the floor!<p>

<a
href="http://www.nba.com/pacers/dance/pacemate_profile_amanda_2005.html"><b>Amanda:</b></a>
When I was cheering at an IU game, I went back for a back handspring
and in the middle of Assembly Hall court, I landed flat on my head.<p>

<a
href="http://www.nba.com/pacers/dance/pacemate_profile_kim_2005.html"><b>Kim:</b></a>
When I was in sixth grade, I slipped and fell on the ice trying to get
on the school bus. I had on a skirt and dress shoes and was carrying
my trumpet!
</blockquote>

I don't know what the trumpet has to do with it, but my cat and I can
sympathize with the part about slipping on the ice while trying to
board the school bus.<p>

I find it rather comforting that the Pacemates are embarrassed by the
same things that embarrass me or  my cat or both.    I had been
worried that all the embarrassing moments would be strange and
puzzling, like this one:<p>

<blockquote>
<a
href="http://www.nba.com/pacers/dance/pacemate_profile_ashley_2005.html"><b>Ashley:</b></a>
Crashing into the back of a trash truck and totaling my car!
</blockquote>

Items like this had made me wonder if the author and I were using the
word in the same way.  But for the most part I felt that I could
understand and empathize, and when I looked at the complete list, I
was delighted to discover just what I had asked for:<p>

<blockquote> <a
href="http://www.nba.com/pacers/dance/pacemate_profile_nikki_2005.html"><b>Nikki:</b></a>
During speech class of my freshman year of college, I was giving a
speech on the health care industry and I...well, let's just say for
the rest of the semester, my classmates nicknamed me "Toot-Toot!"  <p>
</blockquote>
 
There is a crucial scene in Larry Niven's novel <cite>World of
Ptavvs</cite> about embarrassment among aliens.  Kzanol is an alien
invader.  In order to escape from Kzanol's telepathic control, the
protagonist, Larry Greenberg, must understand how the aliens shield
themselves from each others' commands.  He has access to Kzanol's
memories, and finds the memory he wants in an episode from Kzanol's
childhood in which Kzanol involuntarily defecated in front of his
father's houseguests.  I'm sure that Pacemate Nikki would
sympathize.<p>
